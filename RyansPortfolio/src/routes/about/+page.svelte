	<h3>
		Hey! My name is Ryan Hanson and I am a student at Western Oregon University.
	</h3>
	<h3>
		This app is my portfolio for my work in CS407 - Computer Graphics. I have created a few different projects for this class and I have them all linked in the navigation bar at the top of the page as well as on the home page.
	</h3>
